# Hello World!

Welcome to my first blog post using **MDX**! This is a powerful way to write content with embedded React components.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

### Features of MDX

- **React Components**: Embed React components directly in your markdown
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks with beautiful syntax highlighting
- **Rich Content**: Create rich content with JSX and markdown combined

Here's a simple example of React code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

export default Greeting;
```

## Tables

MDX also supports tables:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Components | Import and use React components |
| Markdown | Use all standard markdown features |
| JSX | Write JSX directly in your content |
| Code Highlighting | Syntax highlighting for code blocks |

## Images

You can include images in your MDX files:

## Lists

Unordered lists:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
  - Nested item 1
  - Nested item 2

Ordered lists:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Custom Components

One of the most powerful features of MDX is the ability to use custom components:

<div>
  This is a custom div component with a border around it!
  
  You can put any content inside, including more markdown:
  
  - Lists
  - **Bold text**
  - *Italic text*
</div>

## Links

You can create [internal links](/about) or [external links](https://github.com).

## Conclusion

MDX provides a powerful way to create rich content with React components. It's perfect for blogs, documentation sites, and any content-heavy application.

Happy coding!
